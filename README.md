# OurMinibase
This is a school project meant to exercise the theory behind an engine for a Relational Database.

Aravind, I'm also kind of new to the world of github and wanted to share this tutorial I found on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds where you can learn the fundamentals. Its a good starting point. Also check out this demo on how to do branching on git http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?demo

Notice that right now there a master branch and a part1 branch. As we make progress on the part1 branch we can merge onto the master branch. Think of the master branch as our golden product.

Finally, on the 'part1' branch you can compile using 'make' and it should automatically compile the TestHashTable class I set up which for temp testing. For now it only diplays a message in the terminal.
