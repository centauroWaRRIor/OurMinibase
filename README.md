This is a school project meant to exercise the theory behind a Relational Database's engine.

Aravind, I'm also kind of new to the world of github and wanted to share this tutorial I found on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds where you can learn the fundamentals. Its a good starting point.

Notice that right now there a master branch and a part1 branch. As we make progress on the part1 branch we can merge onto the master branch. Think of the master branch as our golden product.
