# OurMinibase
This is a school project for a Databases class that meant to exercise the theory behind a Relational Database's engine using Java.

The project was divided into 4 parts corresponding to different layers of the engine. Furthermore, each part of the project was designed so that it could be developed independently from the other parts. Therefore, each branch of this repository represents a given part of the project that is fully functional and has its own makefile. 

At the end of the class we've merged all the source code into the master branch but we haven't tried to create a makefile that puts it all together into a single app. For now, only branches are fully functional.
