This is a school project meant to exercise the theory behind a Relational Database's engine.

Aravind, I'm also kind of new to the world of github and wanted to share this tutorial I found on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73I5dRucCds where you can learn the fundamentals. Its a good starting point.

Notice that right now there a master branch and a part1 branch. As we make progress on the part1 branch we can merge onto the master branch. Think of the master branch as our golden product.

Finally, on the 'part1' branch you can compile using 'make' and it should automatically compile the TestHashTable class I set up which for temp testing. For now it only diplays a message in the terminal.
